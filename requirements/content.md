## Content Requirements:

- Each slide should contain minimal text - focus on key numbers, statistics, or single important phrases
- Prioritize visual elements: diagrams, charts, icons, illustrations, or large impactful numbers
- Extract the main chapters/sections from the notes to create a logical flow of slides
- Each major point should get its own slide rather than cramming multiple points together
- Make sure the presentation flows logically and each slide serves a clear purpose.
